<h1 align="center">.NET REST API</h1>

This is a simple CRUD Application using .NET Core 5 Web API. ASP.NET makes it easy to build services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. With ASP.NET you use the same framework and patterns to build both web pages and services, side-by-side in the same project.
